# Packaging Final Report — ESM-only Publication Readiness

Date: 2025-10-21

## Summary

We finalized an ESM-only, minimal npm package configuration:

- Added a strict files whitelist in package.json
- Simplified exports to ESM-only (removed require and internal paths)
- Added standard metadata (license, repository, bugs, homepage, author)
- Marked sideEffects: false for tree-shaking
- Added prepublishOnly guard to run lint and tests on publish
- Updated README to reflect MIT license and ESM-only with Node 18+

## Changes Made

1) package.json

- exports: `{ ".": { "import": "./index.js", "default": "./index.js" } }`
- files whitelist:
  - index.js, index.cjs, core/**, config/**, context/**, error-handling/**, rate-limiting/**, sanitizer/**, sync/**, transports/**, utils/**, README.md, LICENSE, package.json
- metadata: license=MIT, repository, bugs, homepage, author
- sideEffects=false
- scripts: added `prepublishOnly: npm run lint:ci && npm test`

1) README.md

- Added note: ESM-only, Node.js 18+
- Corrected license section to MIT

## npm pack (dry-run) — New Snapshot

Command: `npm pack --dry-run`

- Total files: 52 (down from 124)
- Tarball size: ~88.1 kB (down from ~197 kB)
- Unpacked size: ~387.7 kB (down from ~871 kB)
- Only whitelisted files included (no .github, tests, scripts, internal, or CI configs)

## Validation

- Lint (CI strict): PASS (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- Tests: PASS (basic + core runner)
- Coverage task: PASS (unchanged behavior)
- prepublishOnly: Configured to run lint:ci + test (guards future publishes)

## Notes

- CommonJS require is no longer advertised (ESM-only). `index.cjs` remains in the tarball for historical reference but is not used by exports.
- If CJS support is needed later, introduce a real CJS wrapper or a transpiled build and re-add a `require` subpath in exports.

## Next Steps

- Optional: remove `index.cjs` from the files whitelist if you want to avoid any CJS confusion in consumers (not referenced by exports).
- When ready, run an actual publish from a clean CI context after tagging (ensure 2FA and provenance settings as desired).

This concludes Phase 5.1 — the repository is prepared for npm publication under an ESM-only configuration.
