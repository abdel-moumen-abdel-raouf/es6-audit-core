# Project Fixes Summary

Date: 2025-10-20
Branch: fix/all-issues-2025-10-20

## Overview

Applied all prioritized fixes from PROJECT_WEAKNESSES_REPORT.md, focusing on async correctness, transport interface alignment, secure sanitization defaults, CommonJS interop, metrics memory bounds, export consistency, and minimal test coverage.

## Fixes by Section

1. Security: PII masking defaults (Report 3.1)

- Files: `sanitizer/data-sanitizer.js`, `utils/log-entry.js`
- Changes: Enabled masking for emails, IPs, and phones by default. Ensured `LogEntry` uses secure sanitizer defaults.
- Outcome: Sensitive PII patterns are redacted by default.

1. Reduce console leakage (Report 3.2)

- Files: `core/core-logger.js`
- Changes: Tightened console error messages to avoid printing full objects; kept concise messages.
- Outcome: Lower risk of leaking sensitive data in internal errors.

1. Async buffer correctness (Report 3.3, 3.13)

- Files: `core/core-logger.js`, `transports/console-transport.js`, `transports/file-transport.js`, `transports/http-transport.js`
- Changes: Made `CoreLogger.log` async and awaited `buffer.push`. `_handleFlush` is now async and awaits transport writes. Added `write(entries)` for transports or fallback to per-entry `log`.
- Outcome: Correct backpressure handling; reliable flush with proper error catching.

1. Transport interface mismatch (Report 3.5)

- Files: `core/core-logger.js`, `transports/console-transport.js`, `transports/file-transport.js`, `transports/http-transport.js`
- Changes: Implemented batch-capable `write(entries)` in transports and added fallback in `CoreLogger` to iterate entries via `log`.
- Outcome: Batches are handled safely; legacy transports remain compatible.

1. Re-export and naming fixes (Report 3.6)

- Files: `transports/index.js`, `index.js`
- Changes: Exported `AdvancedHttpTransport as HttpTransport`, re-exposed default `LogBuffer`, standardized `PayloadOptimizer` naming.
- Outcome: Import paths align with actual implementations and work as documented.

1. Incomplete CJS interop (Report 3.7)

- Files: `package.json`, `index.cjs`
- Changes: Added `"require": "./index.cjs"` to exports for CommonJS consumers. Documented interop in `index.cjs` (already present).
- Outcome: `require(...)` resolves to CJS shim; ESM remains default.

1. Example/doc divergence (Report 3.8)

- Files: `utils/example-logger-usage.js`
- Changes: Updated sample to reflect `CoreLogger` API; removed non-existent methods and made logging calls async.
- Outcome: Examples are consistent with the implemented API.

1. LoggingError misuse (Report 3.9)

- Files: `error-handling/errors.js`
- Changes: Made constructor flexible to support `(message)` or `(code, message, context)`.
- Outcome: Existing call sites remain valid; error metadata preserved.

1. File transport throughput (Report 3.4)

- Files: `transports/file-transport.js`
- Changes: Switched to persistent write streams with backpressure awareness and grouped writes.
- Outcome: Improved throughput and lower syscall overhead under load.

1. Metrics histogram memory (Report 3.14)

- Files: `metrics/metrics-collector.js`
- Changes: Added `maxHistogramValues` (default 2048) and pruning logic.
- Outcome: Bounded memory usage for histograms.

1. jsconfig include pattern (Report 3.15)

- Files: `jsconfig.json`
- Changes: Fixed include glob and trailing comma.
- Outcome: Cleaner editor tooling behavior.

## Tests and Validation

- Added: `tests/basic.test.js` (Node-based, no framework) to validate:
  - Async logging path and flush with `ConsoleTransport`
  - Sanitizer default masking of email/phone
- Run: node ./tests/basic.test.js
- Result: All tests passed.
